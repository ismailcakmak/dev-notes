Object shorthand notatation:
This came in 2015 


## Object creation shorthand
rather than creating object like this :

```js
const name = "Bob";
const age = 28;
const color = "red";

const thatObject = { name: name, age: age, color: color };

```

it is now possible to create it like this :

```js
const name = "Bob";
const age = 28;
const color = "red";

const nowFancyObject = { name, age, color };
```

this creates an object that has name, age, color as key and corresponding values of these variables. here the object created : 

```
nowFancyObject = {
    name : "Bob",
    age : 28,
    color : "red"
}
```


by this notation, it is possible to console.log values neatly! : 

```js
//old way
console.log(name, age, color);

//new better way
console.log({ name, age, color });
```

it logs as : 
```
{name: "Bob", age: 28, color: "red" }
```


## Object desstructing shorthand 
When you have an object, you can extract a property of an object into a variable of the same name. This is known as destructuring, it extract values from the object and assigns it to the varaibles.

Here the example :

```js
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const { a, b } = obj;

//now a and b can be used as normal const variables

let c = a + b;
```


not : burda objenin extract edilecek value sunun key i ne ise variable ın da ismi o olmak zorunda. yani şu çalışmaz : 

```js
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const { c, d } = obj;

// c and d are undefined
```


### Array deconstruction 

bu yöntem ile arrayler de pratik bir şekilde deconstruct edilebilirler. Sonuc olarak arrayler de birer obje.

Örnek bir kod :
```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const [ a, b ] = array;

//a = 1 and b=2 now
```


this is also possible :
```js
[a, b, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

//a = 10, b=20 and rest equals to [30,40,50] now
```
