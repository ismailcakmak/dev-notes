# Understanding Error Handling in Express.js API Routes: A Beginner's Guide

When building web applications with Express.js and MongoDB, properly handling errors is crucial for creating robust APIs. In this post, we'll break down how to manage different types of errors when fetching and updating data from a database, using clear examples that even beginners can understand.

## The Two Types of "Not Found" in API Requests

When a user requests a resource from your API, there are two fundamentally different scenarios that might result in a "not found" situation:

1. **Valid request, but no matching data** - The operation works correctly, but there's simply no data matching what was requested
2. **Invalid request that causes an error** - Something about the request itself prevents the operation from executing properly

Let's explore these differences with practical examples.

## Basic Error Handling: Finding a Note by ID

Here's a basic Express route that retrieves a note from a database by its ID:

```js
app.get('/api/notes/:id', (request, response) => {
  Note.findById(request.params.id)
    .then(note => {
      if (note) {
        response.json(note)
      } else {
        response.status(404).end()
      }
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.log(error)
      response.status(500).end()
    })
})
```

This code handles two distinct scenarios:

### Scenario 1: The ID Format is Valid, But No Note Exists

When a user requests a note with a valid-looking ID that doesn't exist in our database, `findById()` will successfully execute its query but find nothing. The function returns `null`, which we check with the `if (note)` condition. In this case, we send a `404` status code, meaning "Not Found."

For example, if someone requests `/api/notes/507f1f77bcf86cd799439011` (a valid MongoDB ID format) but no note with this ID exists, they'll receive a 404 response.

### Scenario 2: The ID Format is Invalid or Another Error Occurs

If a user requests something like `/api/notes/123` (which isn't a valid MongoDB ObjectID format), the `findById()` operation will fail and throw an error. This causes the code to skip the `.then()` block completely and jump straight to the `.catch()` block, where we log the error and return a `500` status code (Server Error).

Without that `.catch()` block, Express would still handle the error with its default error handler, keeping your server running. However, this default handling would:

- Send a generic HTTP 500 response to the client
- Provide minimal error details (especially in production mode)
- Make debugging more difficult
- Create a less professional user experience

## Improved Error Handling with Specific Messages

While basic error handling works, we can make our API much more user-friendly by providing specific error messages. Here's an improved version:

```js
app.get('/api/notes/:id', (request, response) => {
  Note.findById(request.params.id)
    .then(note => {
      if (note) {
        response.json(note)
      } else {
        response.status(404).end() 
      }
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.log(error)
      
      if (error.name === 'CastError') {
        return response.status(400).send({ error: 'malformatted id' })
      } else if (error.name === 'ValidationError') {
        return response.status(400).json({ error: error.message })
      } else {
        // For connection issues, server errors, etc.
        return response.status(500).send({ error: 'server error' })
      }
    })
})
```

In this improved version, we examine the specific type of error:

- **CastError**: Occurs when trying to convert an invalid ID format to MongoDB's ObjectID type. We return a `400 Bad Request` status with a helpful message.
- **ValidationError**: Happens when data doesn't meet schema requirements. We return the specific validation error message.
- **Other errors**: For database connection issues or server problems, we return a general server error message.

This approach gives clients much clearer feedback about what went wrong, making your API more developer-friendly.

## Handling Errors When Updating Data

Error handling is equally important when updating data. Let's look at a PUT request example:

```js
app.put('/api/notes/:id', (request, response, next) => {
  const {content, important} = request.body;
  const noteId = request.params.id;
  
  Note.findById(noteId)
    .then(note => {
      if(!note) {
        response.status(404).end();
      } else {
        note.content = content;
        note.important = important;
        note.save()
          .then(savedNote => {
            response.json(savedNote);
          });
      }
    })
    .catch(error => next(error))
})
```

Here's how `findById()` behaves in different scenarios:

1. **Valid ID and note exists**: The promise resolves successfully with the note object.
2. **Valid ID but no matching note**: The promise resolves with `null`.
3. **Invalid ID format**: The promise rejects with a CastError.
4. **Other errors** (like database connection issues): The promise rejects with the specific error.

In this example, if we encounter an error, we pass it to the `next(error)` function instead of handling it directly. This allows us to centralize error handling in Express middleware, which is a more advanced but very powerful pattern.

## Practical Tips for Error Handling

When building your own APIs, keep these principles in mind:

1. **Always include proper error handling** for any database operations to maintain control over how errors are presented to users.
2. **Distinguish between "not found" and "error" scenarios** with appropriate status codes.
3. **Provide specific error messages** to help API users understand what went wrong.
4. **Log errors on the server side** to help with debugging, but be careful not to expose sensitive details to clients.
5. **Consider using centralized error handling middleware** in Express for consistent error responses across your entire API.

By mastering these error handling patterns, you'll create APIs that gracefully handle problematic requests, making life easier for both you and the developers using your API. While Express won't crash your server when errors occur, proper error handling gives you control over the user experience and makes debugging much easier.
