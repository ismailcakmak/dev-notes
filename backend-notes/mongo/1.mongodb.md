# Understanding MongoDB: A Beginner's Guide

MongoDB is a popular database system that works quite differently from traditional databases like SQL. In this post, I'll explain how MongoDB organizes data and why its flexible approach can be helpful for your projects. I'll use simple language and examples to make these concepts easy to understand, even if you're just starting out.

## How MongoDB Organizes Data

MongoDB organizes data in a hierarchy that goes from largest to smallest:

1. **Cluster** - This is the top level container that holds everything else
2. **Databases** - Inside a cluster, you can have multiple databases for different projects
3. **Collections** - Each database contains collections (similar to tables in SQL)
4. **Documents** - Collections hold documents (similar to rows in SQL, but more flexible)

Let's imagine you're building two different projects:

- An e-commerce website
- A blog platform

You might create one MongoDB cluster and put two databases inside it - one for each project.

For the blog database, you could have collections like:

- users (storing information about people who use the blog)
- blog-posts (storing the actual blog content)
- comments (storing comments people leave on posts)

## The Beauty of Document Databases: They're Schemaless

One of the most powerful features of MongoDB is that it's "schemaless." 
For example, these two completely different documents can exist in the same collection with no problems:

```js
// First document - a user
{
  "_id": ObjectId("123"),
  "name": "Alex",
  "email": "alex@example.com"
}

// Second document - a completely different entity
{
  "_id": ObjectId("456"),
  "product": "Laptop",
  "price": 999,
  "specs": {
    "ram": "16GB",
    "storage": "512GB"
  }
}
```

## Why Use Schemas When MongoDB Doesn't Require Them?

Despite MongoDB being schemaless at the database level, we almost always impose schemas at the application level (especially when using Mongoose with Node.js). There are several important reasons for this:

- **Data Consistency**: Without a schema, it's easy to end up with inconsistent data (for example, sometimes storing "email" and other times "emailAddress")
- **Validation**: Schemas help ensure data meets certain criteria before saving (like making sure an email field actually contains a valid email address)
- **Developer Experience**: Schemas provide autocompletion, type checking, and documentation about what fields should exist
- **Predictable Code**: Your application code can rely on certain fields existing, making it more reliable
- **Maintainability**: New developers can understand your data structure more easily

So, if we still end up using schemas, why bother with a schemaless database? The real benefit isn't having no schema - it's the ability to evolve your schema without painful migrations:

1. You can add new fields to your schema without affecting existing documents
2. You can gradually migrate data structures as your application grows
3. You can support multiple versions of your application with slightly different data needs

## Working with MongoDB in Practice

### Creating a Collection and Adding Your First Document

When using Mongoose (a popular MongoDB library for Node.js), we create a schema and model like this:

```js
const noteSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  content: String,
  important: Boolean,
})

const Note = mongoose.model('Note', noteSchema)
```

This code creates a schema and a collection. The collection name in our code is "Note" but MongoDB will convert this to lowercase and plural form in the database. So if you look at your database in MongoDB Atlas (MongoDB's cloud service), you'll see this collection as "notes".

The `Note` model is the object that makes us interact with the notes collection created in database. It's actually a class, and we can create new documents by making instances of this class.

Here's how we create a new document:

```js
const note = new Note({
  content: 'HTML is Easy',
  important: false,
})
```

These model objects have methods like `.save()` for saving new documents, as well as static methods like `.find()` or `.findById()` for querying data.

And here's how we save it to the database:

```js
note.save().then(result => {
  console.log('note saved!')
  mongoose.connection.close()
})
```

### Which Database Are We Using?

If you don't specify a database name when running these commands, MongoDB will create and use a database called "test" by default.

There are two main ways to specify which database to use:

#### 1. In the connection string (preferred method)

```js
const url = `mongodb+srv://username:${password}@cluster0.774ls.mongodb.net/myCustomDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0`
```

Notice the `/myCustomDatabase` part before the question mark. This tells MongoDB which database to use.

#### 2. In the Mongoose connect options

```js
mongoose.connect(url, { dbName: 'myCustomDatabase' })
```

This approach is useful when you want to dynamically determine the database name in your code.

### Fetching Objects from the Database

We can use the `.find()` method to retrieve documents from a collection:

```js
Note.find({}).then(result => {
  result.forEach(note => {
    console.log(note)
  })
  mongoose.connection.close()
})
```

The empty curly braces `{}` in `.find({})` indicate that we want to retrieve all documents in the collection. We can specify search conditions by adding key-value pairs inside these braces.

For example, this will return only documents where the "important" field is set to true:

```js
Note.find({ important: true }).then(result => {
  // ...
})
```

### About Closing the Database Connection

When working with MongoDB, it's important to close the connection properly, especially in scripts that don't run continuously. But you need to make sure you don't close the connection too early!

For example, this code won't work:

```js
Person
  .find({})
  .then(persons=> {
    // ...
  })

mongoose.connection.close()
```

The problem here is that `mongoose.connection.close()` will execute immediately after starting the `Person.find` operation, before the database has returned any results. This means the connection will be closed before the database can respond, and our callback function will never get called.

The correct place to close the connection is at the end of the callback function:

```js
Person
  .find({})
  .then(persons=> {
    // ...
    mongoose.connection.close()
  })
```

**Note**: In a backend server (like an Express.js server), you typically connect to MongoDB once when the server starts up, and you don't need to close the connection until the server shuts down. That's why you might not see `connection.close()` in server code. You'll use it more often in scripts that run and then terminate, rather than in servers that stay running.
